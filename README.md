 Ansible Project: Web Server and Database Server Configuration

Description:
This Ansible project aims to automate the configuration of two distinct server roles: web server and database server. The project leverages Ansible's declarative syntax and idempotent nature to ensure consistent and reproducible server configurations across environments.

Roles:
1. Web Server Role:
   - This role is responsible for configuring the web server components, such as Apache or Nginx, PHP, SSL certificates, and any necessary dependencies.
   - Tasks within this role include installing and configuring the web server software, managing virtual hosts, setting up firewall rules, and deploying web applications or static websites.

2. Database Server Role:
   - The database server role focuses on setting up and managing database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
   - Tasks include installing the database server software, configuring databases and users, optimizing performance settings, and ensuring data security measures are in place.

Features:
- Modular Structure: The project is organized into separate roles for web server and database server, allowing for easy customization and scalability.
- Parameterized Configuration: Utilizes Ansible variables to parameterize configurations, enabling flexibility and reusability across different server environments.
- Idempotent Execution: Ansible playbooks ensure idempotent execution, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended changes, promoting reliability and consistency.
- Role Dependencies: Roles can be independently executed or combined as needed, simplifying maintenance and reducing complexity.
- Error Handling: Includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures during playbook execution, with logging for troubleshooting purposes.

With this Ansible project, you can efficiently automate the setup and management of web and database servers, streamlining deployment processes and reducing manual intervention.
